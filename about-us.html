<div><p>Phoenix Home Remodeling was started because the industry didn&rsquo;t give homeowners the control they deserve.</p>

<p>Our unique &amp; innovative design-build approach gives you unparalleled control and insight into the design and construction.</p>

<p>Our design-build process also allows you to &lsquo;test drive&rsquo; us without committing to the construction agreement.  </p>

<p>So you can plan your whole remodel, and know what you&rsquo;re getting before signing your construction agreement.</p>

<p>You also get a fixed price because every aspect of your remodel was thoroughly planned beforehand.<br />
So there are no hidden fees!</p>

<p>As a homeowner, using a design-build company is the one way you can protect yourself from many of the contractor nightmares.</p>
