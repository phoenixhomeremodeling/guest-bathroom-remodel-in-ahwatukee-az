<div class="card-body"><p>The choice between a small prefab walk-in shower, typically costing between $400 to $700, may be more economical for older homes with smaller bathrooms, while newer constructions with larger bathrooms and more space may find it cost-effective to install a larger walk-in shower, ranging from $4,000 to $7,000.</p>

<div class="collapse" id="collapse2" aria-labelledby="heading2" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>When it comes to painting the bathroom, selecting blue shades can significantly boost home values, with light periwinkle contributing to an increase of $2,786 and pale shades generally being the most suitable choice for bathroom decor, as bathrooms are nearly as crucial as kitchens in terms of their impact on home value, potentially raising it by up to $5,440.</p>
