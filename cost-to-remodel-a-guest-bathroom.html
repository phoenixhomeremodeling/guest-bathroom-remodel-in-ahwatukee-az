      "text": "In summary, a bathroom remodel will typically cost less than half of what a general contractor (GC) would charge, as it allows you to keep the material costs while saving on labor expenses, but the decision to hire a GC may be justified for the convenience it offers, which can be considered a luxury worth the additional cost."
