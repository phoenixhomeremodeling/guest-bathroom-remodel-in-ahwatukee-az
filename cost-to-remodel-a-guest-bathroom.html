<div class="collapse" id="collapse0" aria-labelledby="heading0" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Completing your bathroom renovation for under $10,000 and on schedule may be more cost-effective than installing under-floor heating; to achieve this, establish a strict budget, thoroughly plan the project from the outset, obtain multiple quotes, and consult with experts such as plumbers, tilers, and electricians.</p>

<div class="collapse" id="collapse1" aria-labelledby="heading1" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>To create an affordable shower, opt for a straightforward design utilizing cost-effective materials, such as pre-fabricated shower kits, acrylic or fiberglass walls, basic plumbing fixtures, a shower curtain instead of an enclosure, and standard tiles or a basic shower base.</p>
