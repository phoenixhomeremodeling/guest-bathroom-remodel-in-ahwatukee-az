<div class="collapse" id="collapse3" aria-labelledby="heading3" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Before embarking on a bathroom remodel, it&#39;s essential to consider various factors, including the space requirements for a half bath, designing for accessibility, creating niches for toiletries, determining the appropriate accessory heights, upgrading electrical wiring, adding heated flooring, optimizing vanity lighting, and avoiding the use of wallpaper, among other considerations.</p>

<div class="card-body"><p>Completing your bathroom renovation for under $10,000 and on schedule may be more cost-effective than installing under-floor heating; to achieve this, establish a strict budget, thoroughly plan the project from the outset, obtain multiple quotes, and consult with experts such as plumbers, tilers, and electricians.</p>
